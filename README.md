# LU Factorization
This function can be used to develop the lower and upper triangular matrix of any square matrix. 
With an input of any square matrix, the function will itterate through row opperations. 
These row opperations will not only give the lower and upper triangular matrices, but also a pivot matrix, telling the user which rows were switched.
